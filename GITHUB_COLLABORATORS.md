# 🚀 GitHub Collaborators Setup Guide

## 📋 Adding Collaborators to Miel Repository

### 🔐 Step 1: Repository Access

1. **Go to GitHub Repository**
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Miel-DatingApp`
   - Click on **Settings** tab

2. **Add Collaborators**
   - Click on **Collaborators and teams** in the left sidebar
   - Click **Add people** button
   - Enter GitHub username or email of the collaborator

### 🎯 Step 2: Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Go to Branch Protection**
   - In Settings, click **Branches**
   - Click **Add rule** or edit existing `main` branch rule

2. **Configure Protection Rules**
   ```
   ✅ Require a pull request before merging

   ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   ```

### 🛠️ Step 3: Development Workflow Setup

#### For Each Collaborator:

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Miel-DatingApp.git
   cd Miel-DatingApp
   ```

2. **Set Up Git Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Set your name and email
   git config user.name "Your Name"
   git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
   
   # Verify configuration
   git config --list
   ```

3. **Create Development Branch**
   ```bash
   # Create and switch to development branch
   git checkout -b development
   
   # Push development branch
   git push -u origin development
   ```

### 📝 Step 4: Issue Templates

Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory with templates:

#### Bug Report Template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`)
```markdown

title: '[BUG] '
labels: 'bug'
assignees: ''
---

### 🔄 Step 5: Pull Request Template

```markdown
## 🎯 Description
Brief description of changes made.

## 🧪 Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)

## 🖼️ Screenshots (if applicable)
Add screenshots to help explain your changes.

## 📝 Additional Notes

```

### 🚀 Step 6: GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated testing:
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Type check
      run: npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 📊 Step 6: Project Management

#### GitHub Projects Setup
1. **Create Project Board**
   - Go to **Projects** tab
   - Click **New project**
   - Choose **Board** template

2. **Configure Columns**
   ```
   📋 Backlog
   🔄 In Progress
   👀 Review
   ✅ Done
   ```

3. **Automate Workflow**
   - Connect issues to project
   - Set up automation rules
   - Link PRs to issues

### 🎯 Step 7: Communication Guidelines

#### Issue Labels
Create these labels in repository:
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `priority: high` - High priority issues
- `priority: low` - Low priority issues
- `priority: medium` - Medium priority issues

#### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/feature-name
bugfix/bug-description
hotfix/urgent-fix
docs/documentation-update
refactor/refactoring-description
```

### 🔐 Step 8: Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
   - Document required environment variables

2. **Code Review Process**
   - Require PR reviews for main branch
   - Set up automated security scanning
   - Regular dependency updates

3. **Access Control**
   - Limit admin access to repository owners
   - Use branch protection rules
   - Regular access review

### 📞 Step 9: Onboarding Checklist
