## Scalability Guard

- Avoid full table scans in production queries.
- Always consider indexing when adding new filters.
- Never introduce blocking loops in server actions.
- Prefer database-level pagination over in-memory slicing.
- Avoid unbounded queries (always use take / limit).
- Use Promise.all for independent parallel queries.
- Be cautious with include in Prisma queries (avoid include: true).
- Any new filter must be evaluated for index impact.
