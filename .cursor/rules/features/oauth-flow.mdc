## OAuth Rules

- Never hardcode callbackUrl to "/members".
- Redirect logic must check profileComplete.
- OAuth users without Member must go to /complete-profile.
- Member creation must happen via completeSocialLoginProfile().
- Do not create Member inside NextAuth signIn callback.
- profileComplete must only be true after Member exists.
