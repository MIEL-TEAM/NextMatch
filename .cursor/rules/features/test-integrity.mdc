## Test Integrity

- If a change affects filtering, search, auth, premium, or AI – suggest relevant tests.
- Never modify query logic without verifying edge cases.
- If updating age or city filtering logic, verify boundary conditions.
- If modifying OAuth or profile completion flow, verify user creation and redirect paths.
- If touching premium logic, verify subscription state transitions.
- For SmartMatch changes, validate deterministic behavior for identical inputs.
- Prefer integration-level validation over only unit assumptions.
