# OAuth Verification Badge Implementation

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Database Schema (prisma/schema.prisma)

Added to User model:

```prisma
// OAuth verification
provider       String?  // "google", "facebook", or "credentials"
oauthVerified  Boolean  @default(false)
trustScore     Int      @default(0)
```

### 2. NextAuth Configuration (src/auth.ts)

✅ Updated signIn callback to:

- Set `oauthVerified = true` for Google/Facebook OAuth
- Set `emailVerified` date for OAuth providers
- Increment `trustScore` by +40 for OAuth verification
- Set `provider = "credentials"` and `oauthVerified = false` for email/password login

### 3. User Cards (MemberCard.tsx & SmartMemberCard.tsx)

✅ Added verification badge:

- Blue verified icon (MdVerified) at top-right (absolute top-3 right-3)
- Icon only, no text (clean design)
- Tooltip shows "משתמש מאומת" on hover
- Size: w-7 h-7
- Color: text-blue-500
- Drop shadow for visibility

### 4. Profile Page (ProfileHeader.tsx)

✅ Added two verification displays:

- **Inline with name**: Verified icon next to user name
- **Badge chip**: Small rounded badge showing "מאומת" with icon
- Shows "אימייל מאומת" if email verified but not OAuth
- Clean, minimal design like Instagram/Twitter

### 5. Trust Score Utility (lib/trust-score.ts)

✅ Created trust score calculation:

- OAuth verified: +40 points
- Email verified only: +20 points
- Profile complete: +25 points
- Premium membership: +15 points
- Max score: 100

Functions:

- `calculateTrustScore(user)`: Returns 0-100 score
- `getVerificationBadges(user)`: Returns badge array
- `getTrustLevel(score)`: Returns Hebrew description

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (REQUIRED)

### Step 1: Run Prisma Migration

```bash
cd /Users/User/Documents/Miel-DatingApp
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_oauth_verification
```

This will:

- Add `provider` column to User table
- Add `oauthVerified` column (default: false)
- Add `trustScore` column (default: 0)

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This will update TypeScript types and remove linter errors.

### Step 3: Update Member Queries

Find all places where members are queried and include the user relation:

```typescript
// Example: In getMemberByUserId or similar
const member = await prisma.member.findUnique({
  where: { userId },
  include: {
    user: {
      select: {
        oauthVerified: true,
        emailVerified: true,
      },
    },
    // ... other includes
  },
});
```

Common files to update:

- `src/app/actions/memberActions.ts`
- Any page that displays member cards
- Any page that displays profile

### Step 4: Test OAuth Flow

1. Sign in with Google
2. Check database: `oauthVerified` should be `true`
3. Check database: `trustScore` should be `40`
4. View profile: Should see blue verified badge
5. View in grid: Should see blue verified icon (no text)

### Step 5: Test Credentials Flow

1. Sign up with email/password
2. Check database: `oauthVerified` should be `false`
3. Check database: `provider` should be `"credentials"`
4. Verify email
5. Should NOT show OAuth verified badge

## 📍 Verification Badge Locations

### 1. User Cards (Grid View)

- Location: Top-right corner
- Display: Icon only (no text)
- Size: 7x7 (w-7 h-7)
- Tooltip: "משתמש מאומת"

### 2. Profile Header

- Location: Next to name + badge below
- Display: Icon + "מאומת" chip
- Icon size: 7x7 inline with name
- Badge: Small chip with light blue background

### 3. Chat/Messages (Future)

- Can add small icon next to sender name
- Keep it subtle and inline

## 🔍 Trust Score Breakdown

| Factor                     | Points  | Notes                   |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| OAuth Verified (Google/FB) | +40     | Highest trust indicator |
| Email Verified Only        | +20     | Lower than OAuth        |
| Profile Complete           | +25     | Shows engagement        |
| Premium Member             | +15     | Shows commitment        |
| **Maximum**                | **100** | Sum capped at 100       |

## 📱 User Experience

### For OAuth Users (Google/Facebook):

1. Sign in with Google → Automatic verification
2. Blue verified badge appears immediately
3. Trust score starts at 40 points
4. Profile looks more credible

### For Email Users:

1. Sign up with email/password
2. Verify email → Get "אימייל מאומת" badge
3. Trust score: 20 points (lower than OAuth)
4. Can later connect OAuth to upgrade

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- OAuth verification is automatically set on successful Google/Facebook login
- Cannot be manually changed (prevents fake verification)
- Trust score increments only once (on first OAuth verification)
- Provider field tracks authentication method

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

1. **Add to Chat**: Small verified icon next to sender name
2. **Filter by Verified**: Allow users to filter only verified profiles
3. **Premium Upgrade**: Show both verified + premium badges
4. **Photo Verification**: Add face verification badge
5. **Phone Verification**: Additional +10 trust score points

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Verified badge not showing?

- Check: Is `user` relation included in query?
- Check: Did you run Prisma migration?
- Check: Did you regenerate Prisma client?

### Trust score not incrementing?

- Check: Is user already `oauthVerified = true`?
- Score only increments on FIRST OAuth verification

### TypeScript errors?

- Run: `npx prisma generate`
- Restart: TypeScript server in VS Code
